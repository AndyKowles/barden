<h4>In the heart of YMCA Camp Coniston, the legend of Jesse Charles Barden lives on. His adventurous spirit and kind heart touched us all, leaving an indelible mark on the very fabric of our cherished memories. There was no one quite like Jesse. From his days as a camper to his role as a counselor, Jesse's passion for mentoring children and love for the outdoors shone brightly, inspiring us all. </h4>

Jesse's journey at Camp Coniston began as a proud recipient of a campership. It was here that he discovered his love for Campcraft and Riflery, skills that became foundational to his development and shaped him into the incredible outdoorsman and person we all knew and loved. His pride in being a campership recipient was palpable, and he often spoke of how it changed his life.

<h4> Now, we can honor Jesse's memory by creating a campership in perpetuity. Our goal is to raise $40,000 to provide opportunities for kids who couldn't afford to attend Camp Coniston to have a similar, life-changing, impactful experience. Together, let's ensure that Jesse's legacy of kindness, humility, adventure, and mentorship lives on.  The Jesse Barden Campership will continue to exist and provide opportunities for children to attend Camp Coniston forever, without any end date in sight. </h4>
